    generationPrompt: `**Objective:** Generate shorter, highly engaging video ad scripts by strategically combining scenes from a provided script, focusing on maximizing impact and adhering to specific criteria.

    **Instructions:**

    **Phase 1: Expert Script Combination (Focus: Engagement, Branding, and User Directives)**

    1.  **Role:** Assume the role of an expert video ad script writer specializing in maximizing viewer engagement.
    2.  **Core Task:** Create shorter, impactful script combinations by intelligently selecting and combining scenes from the provided original video ad script.
    3.  **User Directive Interpretation (Crucial):**
        *   **Input Format:** The user has provided their directive in a single free-form text field: {{userPrompt}}.
        *   **Empty Input (No Directive):** If the {{userPrompt}} field is *empty*, the user has provided *no specific directive*. In this case, *follow the "Key Combination Guidelines" below*.
        *   **"Focus" Interpretation (Inclusion):** If the user's directive clearly indicates a *focus* or *emphasis* on specific elements (e.g., "focus on product X," "highlight scenes with cars," "emphasize the family moments"), treat this as an *inclusion* directive. Prioritize scenes containing those elements.
        *   **"Exclusion" Interpretation (Exclusion):** If the user's directive clearly indicates an *exclusion* or *avoidance* of specific elements (e.g., "exclude scenes with person Y," "avoid any shots of the city," "remove scenes with the old logo"), treat this as an *exclusion* directive. *Absolutely avoid* including scenes containing those elements.
        *   **Ambiguous Input (Default to Inclusion):** If the user's directive is ambiguous or doesn't clearly indicate either focus or exclusion (e.g., "cars," "red," "night"), *treat this as an inclusion directive*. Prioritize scenes containing those elements. If it is completely unrelated to the content of the script, ignore it.
    4.  **Key Combination Guidelines (Strictly Adhere):**
        *   **Memorable & Concise:** Each combination must convey the core message of the original ad in a memorable way, using *more than one scene but never all scenes*.
        *   **Prioritize Key Elements:** Scenes featuring logos, brands, products, or on-screen text are *crucial*. Prioritize their inclusion.
        *   **Strong Conclusion:** The *final scene of the original script is paramount*. Always include it as the concluding scene of every combination.
        *   **Speech & Text Coherence:** Prioritize scenes with off-screen speech or on-screen text. Ensure a logical flow and coherent message within the combined scenes. Avoid jarring transitions.
        *   **Target Duration (CRITICAL - Must be within {{expectedDurationRange}}):** Aim for a duration of approximately {{desiredDuration}} seconds. This is an *absolutely critical requirement*. The combined scenes *must* result in a duration within the range of {{expectedDurationRange}}. Use the provided scene durations to calculate the total duration of each combination. *Failing to calculate and adhere to the duration range using the provided durations will result in a score of 1.* To achieve this:
            *   **Duration Calculation (Mandatory):** *Explicitly calculate the total duration* of each combination by summing the durations of the included scenes.
            *   **Scene Selection Strategy:** Carefully consider the estimated length of each scene when selecting them. Prioritize shorter scenes if needed to stay within the duration range.
            *   **Iterative Refinement:** If an initial combination exceeds the duration range, *remove less essential scenes* until it fits. If it's significantly shorter, consider adding a short, relevant scene, if possible.
            *   **Duration is Paramount:** The duration constraint is *more important than including every single prioritized element*. If including all prioritized elements makes the combination too long, *remove some of those elements* to meet the duration requirement.
        *   **No Full-Script Combinations:** *Absolutely never* include all scenes from the original script in a combination.

    **Phase 2: Expert Critique (Rigorous Evaluation and Recommendations)**

    **Phase 3: Scoring and Justification (Detailed Analysis)**

    {{{{generationScorePromptPart}}}}

    **Constraints (Strictly Enforce):**
        *   Each combination must include *more than one scene* but *never all scenes* from the original script.

        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If audio is underutilized, suggest adding a voiceover, relevant sound effects, or background music to enhance the viewing experience. Ensure audio elements complement each other and don't compete.
    *   **Criterion A3 (Visual Interest):** Does the video maintain visual interest throughout with dynamic visuals, varied framing, and captivating imagery?
        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If visuals are static or repetitive, recommend incorporating more dynamic elements like camera movements, transitions, and visually engaging scenes.

    *   **Criterion B1 (Early Branding):** Does the video prominently feature the brand's name, logo, product, or tagline within the first 5 seconds?
        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If not, suggest ways to enhance early brand visibility. For example, enlarge the logo, position it more centrally, or add a subtle animation.
    *   **Criterion B2 (Frequent Branding):** Is the brand integrated at least 3+ times throughout the ad, including the last 5 seconds, using various branding elements like visuals, audio mentions, and product shots?

    *   **Criterion B3 (Branding Variety):** Does the video utilize a variety of branding assets, including the logo, product, tagline, color palette, audio cues, and even mascots or spokespeople?
        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If branding is monotonous, recommend diversifying the use of brand assets. For example, incorporate a brand jingle, use a recognizable brand color scheme, or feature a brand mascot.

    **C - Connection**
    *   **Criterion C1 (Human Presence):** Does the video feature people, ideally with close-ups of faces, to create an immediate and relatable connection with viewers?
        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If human presence is lacking, suggest adding close-ups of expressive faces or scenes of people interacting with the product.
    *   **Criterion C2 (Context and Relevance):** Does the video clearly show how the product or service fits into people's lives by featuring relatable scenarios and diverse characters?
        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If context is unclear, suggest adding scenes that demonstrate the product's use in everyday situations or highlight its benefits for different demographics.
    *   **Criterion C3 (Simplicity and Differentiation):** Does the video convey a single, focused message in a simple and casual language, while also highlighting what makes the brand or product unique?

    **D - Direction**

    *   **Criterion C3 (Clear Value Proposition):** Does the ad clearly and concisely communicate the product's value proposition and benefits, avoiding overwhelming viewers with information?
        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If the value proposition is unclear or overwhelming, suggest focusing on a single key benefit and communicating it in a simple and engaging way.

        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If the call to action is weak or unclear, suggest making it more prominent, using action-oriented language, and aligning it with the specific marketing objective (awareness, consideration, or action).
    *   **Criterion D2 (Visual Support):** Is the call to action visually supported with elements like text, icons, or graphics to make it more engaging and noticeable?
        *   **Recommendation (If Applicable):** If the call to action is purely textual or lacks visual appeal, suggest adding visual elements like buttons, arrows, or animations to make it more prominent.

    **Remember:** Effective YouTube Shorts ads are tailored to the platform's unique DNA, leveraging authenticity, personalization, and an upbeat tone to connect with viewers. By critically evaluating each element and providing specific recommendations, you can help ensure that these ads effectively achieve their marketing objectives, whether it's building awareness, driving consideration, or ultimately leading to action.
